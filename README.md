## issues

i have had alot of issues with this project.
alot of things seem to work well while in the workspace side of things but deploying it to heroku has been an extremely diffcult task which i still havent been able to accomplish constently giving me an Application Error messege even after a "succsesful deploy"
even after following the CodeInstitute instructions many times starting from ther begining over and over again i always bump into the same problem. 
this problem has caused me so much stress and i still dont know what i have been doing wrong. 

becuase of this issue i have not had the time to perfect my actual project. although i have my database set up linking it to the form is yet to be compleate.
my page is very slow now after trying to change things around for the heroku deploy and now sometimes struggles to load and mantain anything in the satic file. 

i belive the website itself when it loads properply looks very nice a welcoming to the user and is good to attract attention to the restaurant

## testing 

i have run out of time to do some proper testing
